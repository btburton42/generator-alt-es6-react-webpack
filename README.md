##Alt React Webpack Single Page App Generator

Scaffolds out your app boilerplate so you don't have to...

A simple SPA scaffold that uses:

*   react
*   alt
*   es6
*   webpack

###Setup

####Initialize the project from within your empty project directory
```
yo react-webpack-es6
```

###Issues and caveats
* For the time being the project inherits the name of the project directory. It capitalizes this for creation of the class object.
